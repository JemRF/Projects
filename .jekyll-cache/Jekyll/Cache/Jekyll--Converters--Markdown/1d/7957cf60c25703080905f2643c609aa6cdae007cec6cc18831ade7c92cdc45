<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot/">AWS IoT Core</a> is a fully managed service designed specifically to allow you to publish telemetry data in a very secure manner to AWS so that the data can be used by downstream services like DynamoDB, Lambda, SNS, SQS, Amazon Kinesis, MQTT, Amazon S3 Bucket, Amazon Kinesis Firehose, CloudWatch, Amazon Elasticserch Service, Salesforce IoT, and Amazon IoT Analytics.</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will provide you with step-by-step instructions to connect our RF sensors with AWS IoT Core, and Amazon CloudWatch (used to graph temperature data).</p>

<p>In this tutorial we will install AWS IoT SDK on the same Raspberry Pi where you have installed a <a href="iot_gateway.html">IoT Gateway</a>.</p>

<p>Make sure you have the full version of Raspberry Pi Raspbian distro installed (not the light version), because we will be using JavaScript (which is not installed on the light version).</p>

<p>We have sample apps developed in JavaScript and Python. You can find installation instructions for Amazon’s IoT SDK’s <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/iot-platform/sdk/">here</a>. Otherwise below we provide abbreviated installation instructions.</p>

<p>Open up a terminal session on the Raspberry Pi and enter the following commands:</p>

<p>Install the JavaScript IoT SDK as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-js.git
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-js
npm install
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Install the Python IoT SDK as follows:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python.git
cd aws-iot-device-sdk-python
python setup.py install

<h2 id="aws-iot-core-background---how-it-works">AWS IoT Core Background - How it works</h2>

<p>The Internet Of Things (IoT) consists of many “things” than can be connected to the internet and are able to send and/or receive data over the internet. A “thing” can be a RaspberryPi, or a thing can be a sensor connected to the RaspberryPi, or any microprocessor capable of connecting to the internet. As you can imagine, security is a major issue with IoT so much of the setup and configuration on AWS IoT is security related. Certificates are created that must be loaded on your “thing” so that it can authenticate with Amazon AWS. You manage the permissions (i.e. what your thing can and can’t do on AWS IoT) using a Policy which is attached to the certificate. Sounds complicated but it is fairly straight forward to configure. Amazon store the latest telemetry from your Thing in a <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/iot-device-shadows.html">“Shadow”</a>. Read more about the Amazon IoT Core <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html">here</a>.</p>

<p>These is a high level overview of the steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a Thing</li>
  <li>Create certificates and save them to a safe location</li>
  <li>Create a policy</li>
  <li>Attach the policy to the certificate</li>
  <li>Attach the certificate to the Thing</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="set-up-a-thing-on-aws-iot-core">Set up a Thing on AWS IoT Core</h2>

<p>You will need to create a Amazon AWS account, or if you already have one log into your <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/console/">console</a>.</p>

<p>Click on the “Services” menu at the top and look for “IoT Core” which is a subset of the Internet Of Things service group. Now we will follow the above 5 steps to create a Thing.</p>

<h3 id="1-create-a-thing">1. Create a Thing</h3>
<p>Click on the “Manage” menu item on the left hand side menu, and then “Create a single thing”. Give your thing a name (we will use RaspberryPi in this example). You can skip over Thing Types, Groups and Attributes as you can input those later if you need them. Click “Next” and then “Create thing without certificate”.</p>

<h3 id="2-create-certificates-and-save-them-to-a-safe-location">2. Create certificates and save them to a safe location</h3>
<p>Click on “Secure” menu item on the left hand side menu, and then “Certificates”. Click the “Create” button on the top right and then click the “Create certificate” button. Download each certificate by clicking the download button and store them in a safe place. There is also an option to download the root CA file. Download that file too (tip - I had to right click the link and use the ‘save link as’ option otherwise it displayed the contents of the file instead of downloading it). Click the “Activate” button and then click “Done”</p>

<h3 id="3---create-a-policy">3.   Create a policy</h3>
<p>Click on “Secure” menu item on the left hand side menu, and then “Policies”. Click the “Create” button on the top right and then give the policy a name. Give the policy a name. For now grant all access by typing <strong>iot:</strong>* in the <strong>Action field</strong>, and * in the <strong>Resource ARN</strong> field. You can come back later and refine the permissions, if required. Click on the “Allow” check box and then the “Create” button.</p>

<p><img src="images/policy_grande.png" width="425" /></p>

<h3 id="4-attach-the-policy-to-the-certificate">4. Attach the policy to the certificate</h3>
<p>Click on “Secure” menu item on the left hand side menu, and then “Certificates”. Click on the “…” on the certificate and then “Attach a policy” . Select the check box next to your policy and then click “Attach”.</p>

<h3 id="5-attach-the-certificate-to-the-thing">5. Attach the certificate to the Thing</h3>
<p>Click on “Secure” menu item on the left hand side menu, and then “Certificates”. Click on the “…” on the certificate and then “Attach a thing” . Select the check box next to your Thing and then click “Attach”.</p>

<p>Now you are ready to connect your Raspberry Pi to AWS!</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="what-you-will-need">What you will need</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Any model Raspberry Pi with preferably the full Raspbian distro</li>
  <li><a href="iot_gateway.html">IoT Gateway</a> for Raspberry Pi or Flex RF Module</li>
  <li>Any <a href="https://www.jemrf.com/collections/all/rf-sensors">wireless sensor</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-you-need-to-know-beforehand">What you need to know beforehand</h3>
<ul>
  <li>How to operate a Raspberry Pi</li>
  <li>You have already set up your <a href="iot_gateway.html">IoT Gateway</a> and <a href="sensor_testing.html">tested your sensor</a></li>
  <li>Some Python programming knowledge is preferable but not mandatory as we provide you with the source code</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>Open up a terminal session on your Raspberry Pi and download the JemRF Amazon IoT library from github:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>git clone https://github.com/JemRF/aws

cd aws
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Type dir to see the contents of the directory. You should see three files:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>pi@raspberrypi:~/aws $ dir
README.md rf2awsiot.js rf2awsiot.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two sample files named rf2awsiot both perform the same function except one is written in JavaScript and the other in Python. You can choose either depending on your preference for Python or JavaScript. We will describe how to use both.</p>

<p>If you plan on using the JavaScript sample then we will be using the SerialPort library (not needed for the Python version). Install it by typing:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>npm install serialport
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="copy-the-certificates-to-the-raspberrypi">Copy the certificates to the RaspberryPi.</h3>
<p>Copy the  Private Key, Root CA and Certificate files over to the Raspberry Pi. These are needed so your Raspberry Pi can connect to AWS.</p>

<h3 id="configure-the-python-sample">Configure the Python sample.</h3>
<p>The sample is based on the <a href="https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-python/tree/master/samples/basicShadow">basicshadow sample</a> from Amazon. All configuration is done through passing parameters to the application.</p>

<p>Usage:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rf2awsiot.py [-h] -e HOST -r ROOTCAPATH [-c CERTIFICATEPATH]
[-k PRIVATEKEYPATH] [-n THINGNAME] 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>HOST = Your REST API End Point (select the “Interact” menu of your Thing to find this)</p>

<p>ROOTCAPATH = the absolute path to your Root CA file</p>

<p>CERTIFICATEPATH = the absolute path to your Certificate file</p>

<p>PRIVATEKEYPATH = the absolute path to your Private Key file</p>

<p>THINGNAME = the name you gave to your Thing</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python rf2awsiot.py -e a1jjw34fr4fhhbq.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com -r /home/pi/aws-keys/root-CA.crt -c /home/pi/aws-keys/certificate.pem.crt -k /home/pi/aws-keys/private.pem.key  -n RaspberryPi
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="configure-the-javascript-example">Configure the JavaScript example</h3>
<p>The configuration is set by editing the file. Use an editor to edit the file and input the configuration items shown in green below:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>const thingName = "RaspberryPi";

const endPoint = 'a1j34fr34frhhbq.iot.us-west-2.amazonaws.com';

keyPath: '/home/pi/aws-keys/private.pem.key',

certPath: '/home/pi/aws-keys/certificate.pem.crt',

caPath: '/home/pi/aws-keys/root-CA.crt',
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Where:</p>

<p>endPoint = Your REST API End Point (select the “Interact” menu of your Thing to find this)</p>

<p>caPath = the absolute path to your Root CA file</p>

<p>certPath = the absolute path to your Certificate file</p>

<p>keyPath = the absolute path to your Private Key file</p>

<p>thingName = the name you gave to your Thing</p>

<p>Execute the script:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>node rf2awsiot.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="viewing-the-device-shadow">Viewing the Device Shadow</h2>
<p>Once you have the application up and running you can view the latest telemetry data being sent by viewing your Thing’s shadow. From the AWS IoT menu select “Manage”, then select “Things”, click on your Thing, then select the “Shadow” menu item. In the window called “Shadow State:” you should see the JSON representation of the wireless sensors sending data to AWS, as shown below.</p>

<p><img src="images/shadow_1024x1024.png" width="425" /></p>

<h2 id="aws-shadow-document">AWS Shadow Document</h2>

<p>In the example above you can see the Shadow document for my RaspberryPi Thing and 4 wireless sensors with their respective telemetry data. Three of the sensors are sending temperature readings (TMPA) and one sensor is a button switch sensor showing the current state of the switch (Open). Device_21 has transmitted a battery level of 2.79V.</p>

<h2 id="data-visualization-using-cloudwatch">Data Visualization using CloudWatch</h2>
<p>Now that you have your data being logged to AWS IoT you can send your data to  Amazon’s many downstream services. In this section we will show you how to configure CloudWatch to display a historical graph of temperature data.</p>

<ul>
  <li>From the AWS IoT menu click on the menu item “Act”, then click on the “Create” button. Give your rule a name enter the following values:</li>
</ul>

<p>Attribute: *</p>

<p>Topic Filter: $aws/things/Decvice_XX/shadow/update/accepted (where XX is the device ID the wireless temperature sensor)</p>

<ul>
  <li>Then click on the “Add Action” button under the “Set one or more actions” section.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/create_rule_1_1024x1024.png" width="425" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Click on the “Send message data to CloudWatch” radio button and then click “Configure Action” button.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Now enter the following values:</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Metric Name: Temperature</p>

<p>Metric namespace: Sensor</p>

<p>Unit: C</p>

<p>Value: ${state.reported.Device_XX.TMPA} (where XX is the device ID the wireless temperature sensor)</p>

<p><img src="images/rule_2_1024x1024.png" width="425" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Click on “Create a new role”, give it a name and then click on “Create a new role” button, then “Update Role”, then select the new role from the list.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="images/rule_3_1024x1024.png" width="425" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>Lastly click on the “Add Action” button and then “Create Rule” button.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now your data will get passed to the CloudWatch service.</p>

<p>Open up Cloud Watch from the AWS Service menu and click on the Browse Metric button. There are many configuration for the graph as shown below.</p>
