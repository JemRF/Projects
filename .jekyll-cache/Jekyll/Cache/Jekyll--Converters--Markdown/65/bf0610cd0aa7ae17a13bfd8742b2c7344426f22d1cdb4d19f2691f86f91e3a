<ul>
  <li>All devices are based on the high-performance RF transceiver based on the market-leading CC1100 SOC</li>
  <li>Wide operating voltage range of 2-3.6V makes the devices suited for battery power</li>
  <li>Current consumption: RX: 16.2 mA , TX: 15.2 mA. Deep Sleep : 0.005Ma (0.5 ÂµA)</li>
  <li>Up to 1KM line of sight. Short range (30M) penetration of walls and floors.</li>
  <li>128-bit AES encryption security</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Driver-less installation</li>
  <li>Gateway communicates through serial port (TTL UART)</li>
  <li>Communicates in ASCII clear text making it very easy to exchange data between devices over the air</li>
  <li>Supports point to point, point to multi-point, multi-point to point and multi-point to multi-point</li>
  <li>Virtually unlimited amount of devices can be deployed. 99,999 Personal Area Network IDâ€™s, 10 channels per frequency and 7,744 Device IDâ€™s per network.</li>
  <li>Super low power consumption allows devices to be use with a coin cell battery for long periods of time (up to 1 year depending on transmission rates).</li>
  <li>Supports 6 frequencies (433 MHZ, 915 MHZ (default US &amp; Canada), 868.3 MHZ (default Europe), 868 MHZ, 903 MHZ, 315 MHZ)</li>
  <li>10 channels</li>
  <li>4 pins for communicating with external micro-controllers like Raspberry Pi and Arduino : Tx, Rx, GND, 3V3</li>
  <li>Battery monitor to keep track of power consumption</li>
</ul>
