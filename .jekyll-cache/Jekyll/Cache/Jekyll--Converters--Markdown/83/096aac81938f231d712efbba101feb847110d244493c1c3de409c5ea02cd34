I"Ó<p>Each Frequency has ten channels that can be used to sub divide radio traffic. There are ten channels supported by our devices.</p>

<p>For two devices to communicate they must have the same <a href="frequency.html">Frequency</a> and Channel and <a href="panid.html">PanID</a>.</p>

<h2 id="channel-default-setting">Channel Default Setting</h2>
<p>Default is 1.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-change-the-channel">How to change the Channel</h2>

<p>The Channel can be changed using the ATCN command.</p>

<p><strong>Command:</strong> ATCN[<em>p1</em>] <br />
<strong>Response:</strong> ATCN[<em>p1</em>]</p>

<p><em>Where</em>: p1 = A number between 1 and 10</p>

<p>The below example changes the Channel to 4:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python rf_config.py 03 ATCH4
SENT     : 03ATCH4
RECEIVED : 03ATCH4----
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The device requires a restart in order to effect the new Channel.</p>
