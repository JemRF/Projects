I"Ü<p>All our RF modules (sensors &amp; IoT Gateway) are configured by sending them <a href="rf_message_reference.html">configuration commands</a>. You can use the <a href="utilities.html">rf_config</a> tool to send configuration changes to the RF module simply by addressing the device_id of the target RF module followed by the configuration change. For example the following command changes the cycle interval of device 75 to 10 minutes:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>python rf_config.py 75 INTVL010 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The sensor will echo back the command (ie: a75INVTL010) if the change was successful or it will send an error (ie: a75ERR) if there was a problem with the command.</p>

<p>In this section of the documentation we will cover the most common configurations in detail. The full list of configurations can be found in the <a href="rf_message_reference.html">message reference</a>.</p>
