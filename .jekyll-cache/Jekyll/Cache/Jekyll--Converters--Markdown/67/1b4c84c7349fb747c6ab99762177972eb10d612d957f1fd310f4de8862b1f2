<h3 id="star-network">Star Network</h3>
<p>Any number of nodes transmitting and receiving data from one central hub. Sensor nodes can sleep to
conserve battery power. No direct communication between the sensor nodes.</p>

<h3 id="multiple-star-networks">Multiple Star Networks</h3>
<p>Start networks can be combined by creating multiple star networks on their own PanIdâ€™s. Messages can
be directed to specific gateways by assigning PanIdâ€™s to each sensor.</p>

<h3 id="redundant-network">Redundant network</h3>
<p>Multiple gateways can be configured on the same PanId to create a redundant network. All radio traffic
travels to all gateways so if you lose a gateway then you have a hot backup. Additional gateways can also
be installed in areas of poor reception to improve network coverage. Message de-duplication logic must be
built either within the gateway or further down in back end systems connected to the network.</p>

<h3 id="point-to-point-communications">Point-to-point Communications</h3>
<p>Two or more MCUâ€™s can communicate directly with each other as shown below.</p>
