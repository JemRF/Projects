To update an RF device (sensor, IOT Gateway or Flex IO) requires connecting the device as to a computer as shown in [Hardware & Firmware](hardware_and_firmware.html).
Once complete you will need a ccti-programmer applicaition.<br />
Download [ccti-prog zip](https://projects.privateeyepi.com/home/home-alarm-system-project/wireless-projects/apps/cctl-prog-v1.zip) for the Windows app ccti-prog.exe.

If you want to use a Raspberry Pi the source for the ccti-prog is included in the zip file with a Makefile.

To compile your own, copy the source to your RPi, then
```
make
gcc -o ccti-prog -Wall ccti-prog.c hex.c
```
Make sure an RF Gateway is attached to the Pi and nothing is using the serial port (e.g. rfsensor.py).

The last step is to get the current firmware for the RF sensors which is [rf_rev7-4.hex](https://projects.privateeyepi.com/home/home-alarm-system-project/wireless-projects/apps/rf_rev7-4.hex)

Then Run the utility:

PC version
```
c:\ccti-prog\ccti-prog.exe -d /comX -f rf_rev7-4.hex
```
pi@raspberrypi:~/pep/cctl-prog $ sudo ./cctl-prog  -d /dev/serial0 -f rf_rev7-4.hex
```

Programming complete
```

The chip now has a new production version installed. Verify it worked by checking the version (rf_config.py 01 VERSION).

Example to display firmware Version:

```
python rf_config.py 01 VERSION
SENT     : 03VERSION
RECEIVED : 03VER7.x---
```
You will need to change the device id to another id, care must be taken because the default device ID for the IOT Raspberry Pi is 01.

The example below changes the Device ID from 01 to 05:
```
python rf_config.py 01 CHDEVID05
SENT     : 01CHDEVID05
RECEIVED : 01CHDEVID05
```
{% include note.html content="The default firmware for the IOT gateway is Version 2.0, bacause as it can not be a sensor. The newer firmware could impact its performance." %}
