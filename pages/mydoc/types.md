The TYPE command is use to set the *personality* of a sensor. In the [Modes of Operation](rf_modes.html) section we described the two modes of an RF module. You use the TYPE command to configure which *mode* you want the module be in. Here is a list of all the types available:

| Type Number| Description | Mode |
|------------|-------------|
| 1  | Thermistor Temperature Sensor| Sensor Mode |
| 2  | Gateway | Gateway Mode| 
| 3  | DHT22 Humidity Sensor |Sensor Mode| 
| 4  | DS18B20 Temperature Sensor |Sensor Mode |
| 5  | Analog A | Sensor Mode|
| 6  | Analog B | Sensor Mode|
| 7  | Relay | Actuator Mode |
| 8  | SHT21 Humidity and Temperature Sensor| Sensor Mode |
| 9  | BME280 Pressure, Humidity and Temperature Sensor| Sensor Mode |
| 10 | HTU21 Humidity and Temperature Sensor| Sensor Mode |


**Command:** TYPE[*p1*] <br>
