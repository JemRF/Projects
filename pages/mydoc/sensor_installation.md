## Sensors
We have a growing list of sensors that you can see in the Products section of this documentation. The sensors do not require any configuration before its intended use. Each sensor comes pre-configured with settings you can find on each product page. For example if you bought a temperature sensor then it would be configured as a temperature sensor and have the required hardware.

You can read more about sensor hardware [here](hardware_and_firmware.html).

You may, however, want to change some of the configuration of a sensor, like give it a different Device ID, or change the reporting interval. See the [configuration section](configuration_overiview.html) of the documentation for more details on changing configuration.

{% include note.html content="
All sensors are pre-configured in a sleep mode which conserves battery power consumption. Read more about SLEEP and AWAKE functions [here](sleep_and_wake.html).
