title: "PrivateEyePi"
keywords: getting started introduction
summary: This is a Raspberry Pi projects website aimed at the Raspberry Pi enthusiast wanting to build home security/automation systems and at the same time learn programming and electronics.

All software and source code we provide is free of charge can be copied, shared and modified without restriction. There are no charges for the alarm system or any of the projects. The parts you will need are described in the projects and can be sourced on your own or bought from the PrivateEyePi Store .

Using your Raspberry Pi you can easily build your own sensors and make your own Internet of Things (IOT).

## Build Sensors
We have many tutorials that show you how to build sensors, or you can build them using hundreds of online tutorials. Some of our sensor tutorials include :

Door switch/Reed switch, Motion Sensor, Temperature Sensor, Humidity Sensor, Web Cam Motion Sensor, Water Sensor.

Using our range of wireless tutorials you can convert your sensor to a wireless battery operated IOT device!

## Connect Your Sensor to The Internet

In each of our projects we show you how to, firstly, build the sensor and secondly connect it to The Internet using your Raspberry Pi. We supply the Python code that you download from our web server.

## Create an Alarm System

PrivateEyePi has a cloud based alarm system where you can group sensors using zones. Zones can be activated and alarms triggered based on rules that you define.

## Control Relays

Some sensors, like relay switches, can be controlled through The Internet. You can also control the alarm system through the PrivateEyePi web based dashboard.

## Monitor

Using our dashboard you can monitor the status of sensors and view temperature and humidity readings in real time from The Internet. Using the PrivateEyePi Analytics you can view historical information. You can see trends using our daily, hourly and detailed data views.

## Trigger

IOT devices are useful for triggering alerts. Using our sophisticated rules engine you can create rules that are processed in real time to create alerts tailored to your needs. You use parameters like sensor values, time of day, days of week, alarm activated/deactivated to define rules specific to individual sensors. The rules can alert you to specific events like a door being opened, motion being detected or temperature or humidity reaching a threshold. You can also use the rules to determine if something hasn't happened. For example you may want to know if no motion has been detected for a time period (popular for monitoring the elderly). Or you may want to know if your garage door was not closed. You can also apply a delay setting to a rule that will only trigger after the rule if valid for a period of time (e.g. garage door open for more than 5 minutes). This is also useful for monitoring the temperature of your house or a fridge where you only want to be alerted after a sustained temperature drop or increase.


## The Internet Of Things (IOT) WiFi Devices
The Internet Of Things WiFi sensors make connecting to The Internet easier than ever. You don't need no be an electronics or software expert or spend a lot of money on proprietary and closed systems to create your own IOT devices and control and monitor them from The Internet.
